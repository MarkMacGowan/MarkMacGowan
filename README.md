- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkMacGowan
At the moment I'm in my 3rd year of studying Computers at NCI.

I have 6 years of Java programming under my belt but I wish to learn more. I still consider myself a bit of a noob at coding.
Can't collaborate on anything at the moment (Too Much College work, so little time..). 
I might progress onto a masters degree at some point, maybe even a phd.

My current area of interest is 3d modelling and video game design, its been three years since my first and only game and it was a good first effort.

If you want to contact me for whatever reason,
I can be found at:
markmacgowan@gmail.com
